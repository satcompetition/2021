	  <li>&#91;12.07.2021&#93; The Cloud track results presented were incorrectly evaluated with respect to a 5000 seconds timeout (instead of 1000 seconds as announced).  
	  This has now been corrected in the <a href='results.html' id='results'>results section</a> 
	  and a corrected set of slides is available in the <a href='downloads.html' id='downloads'>downloads section</a>. 
	  Unfortunately, this has led to a change in the third-placed cloud solver.

	<h3><a name="Objective">Objective</a></h3>
	<p>
	The area of SAT Solving has seen tremendous progress over the last years.
	Many problems (e.g. in hardware and software verification) that seemed to be completely out of reach a decade ago can now be handled routinely.
	Besides new algorithms and better heuristics, refined implementation techniques turned out to be vital for this success.
	</p>
	<p>
	To keep up the driving force in improving SAT solvers, we want to motivate implementors to present their work to a broader audience and to compare it with that of others.
