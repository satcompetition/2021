	<span class='tpl-name'></span> is a competitive event for solvers of the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem.
	It is organized as a satellite event to the 
	<a href="https://sat2020.idea-researchlab.org/"><span class='tpl-afil'></span></a>
	and stands in the tradition of the yearly <a href="http://www.satcompetition.org">SAT Competitions and SAT-Races / Challenges</a>.
	</p>

	<h3><a name="Objective">Objective</a></h3>
	<p>
	The area of SAT Solving has seen tremendous progress over the last years.
	Many problems (e.g. in hardware and software verification) that seemed to be completely out of reach a decade ago can now be handled routinely.
	Besides new algorithms and better heuristics, refined implementation techniques turned out to be vital for this success.
	</p>
	<p>
	To keep up the driving force in improving SAT solvers, we want to motivate implementors to present their work to a broader audience and to compare it with that of others.
