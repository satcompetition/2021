	<h2>CaDiCaL Hack Track</h2>

	<p>
	Hack Tracks have been part of many SAT Competition since 2009.
	The motivation of this track is twofold. 
	On the one hand, we want to lower the threshold for Master's and PhD students to enter the SAT competition 
	by bringing new and innovative ideas to the original CaDiCaL solver. 
	On the other hand, the aim is to see how far the performance of CaDiCaL can be improved 
	by making only minor changes to the source code. 
	</p>

	<p>
	We strongly encourage participants of the Main track (including non-students) to participate with a "hacked" CaDiCaL solver.
	The motivation behind competing with minor hacks is that it can help the community to detect which types of modifications pay off: 
	in order to isolate the actual causes of improvements when modifying solvers, 
	it is necessary to perform scientifically valid experiments on the effects of individual changes made to a solver 
	(e.g., individual new techniques introduced to the base solver).
	</p>

	<p>
	The size of hacks is restricted as follows: the diff between the patched and modified sources of CaDiCaL should be less than 1000 non-space characters.
	You can use our <a href="downloads/editdistance.zip">edit distance tool</a> on all modified files to count the number of modifications, which summed up should be less than 1000.
