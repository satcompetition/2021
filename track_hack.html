	<h2>CaDiCaL Hack Track</h2>

	<p>
	Hack Tracks have been part of many SAT Competition since 2009.
	The motivation of hack tracks is twofold. 
	On the one hand, we want to lower the threshold for Master and PhD students to enter the SAT Competition with new and innovative ideas. 
	On the other hand, the aim is to see how far the performance of CaDiCaL can be improved by making only minor changes to the source code of <a href="https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical/tree/rel-1.4.0">CaDiCaL 1.4</a>. 
	</p>

	<p>
	We strongly encourage all participants of the Main track (including non-students) to participate with a "hacked" CaDiCaL solver.
	Competing with minor hacks helps the community to detect which types of modifications pay off.  
	In order to isolate the actual causes of improvements, 
	it is necessary to perform scientifically valid experiments on the effects of individual changes made to a solver.
	</p>

	<p>
	Participants in the CaDiCaL Hack Track can use the source of the newly released <a href="https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical/tree/rel-1.4.0">CaDiCaL 1.4</a>. 
	The diff between the patched and modified sources of <a href="https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical/tree/rel-1.4.0">CaDiCaL 1.4</a> should be less than 1000 non-space characters.
	You can use our <a href="downloads/editdistance.zip">edit distance tool</a> on all modified files to count the number of modifications.
